# PosiCalc
## aesthetics, arithmetic and autoamity

The spiritual successor to HappyCalc, this project is mainly meant for me to learn more about Obelisk and Reflex FRP, as well as to be my first full app to try to deploy it and get experience with that whole side of things.

I also want to comment this very heavily so that it can function as a tutorial similar to OBchan, but more frontend focused.
