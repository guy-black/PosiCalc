# frontend
- make longform calculations work
  - number pad widget
    - on first click start number segment of equation
    - when click away, convert -. to -0., preface leading . with 0
    - if trailing or naked . or naked -, then highlight problem instead of leaving segment
    - after leaving segment, push it in the correct spot in the list of equation segments
    - if click away to an open parenthesis, add a multiplication sign inbetween, making implicit explicit
  - operators/symbols widget
    - no two consecutive operators
    - clicking on more operators before clicking away just changes the operator
    - cannot click away to closing parenthesis
    - on click away, is pushed to correct spot in the segment list
  - parenthesis widget
    - just keep track of number of parernthesis level
      - on open parenthesis, push an open parenthesis of level to the right spot in segment list, increment paren level
      - close paren only available if
        - paren level > 0 and
        - current active widget isn't operator
      - on close paren, add close paren segment to sement list
    - number parens in segment list
    - only allow solve if paren level 0
  - on solve
    - solve most deeply nested parenthesis
        - print new expression with simplified parenthesis
        - repeat until all parenthesis are gone
      - apply most deeply nested exponents to their bases
        - x^y^z == x^(y^z)  <-- point or order of operations
        - (x^y)^z == x^(y*z) <-- maybe more efficient?
        - print new expression without the exponent
        - repeat until all exponent are gone
      - look left to right for a multplication or division
        - if one is found
          -print new expression with that solved
          - repeat until no more multiplication or division
      - there should only be numbers and plus or minuses now
      - solve leftmost operation and print result until final result
- graphing calculator?
- make it look good
